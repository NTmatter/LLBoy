Project Outline:
 - GameBoy emulator utilizing LLVM for emitting translated bytecode
 - Sources at https://github.com/NTmatter/LLBoy
 - More detailed documentation at http://www.axante.net/projects/llboy
 - Based directly upon http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript

Anti-Piracy Statement:
 - Games, ROMs, or information pointing thereto will not be distributed by the project
 - Software will be designed in a manner that requires an original version of the game cartridge
 - The End-user is responsible for the fair-use format shifting required to use the emulator
 - Hardware emulation is based upon publicly available information

Dependencies:
 - LLVM Core 2.8 (compiled-in to generate native translation)
 - Clang 2.8 (binary only, builds LTO opcode bitcode file)
 - CMake 2.8 (binary only, for building)
 - QT 4.7.0 (will be required later)

Compilation Instructions:
 - mkdir bin
 - cd bin
 - CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DLLVM_ROOT:string=/path/to/llvm/install ../src
 - make all test

Licensing Information:
 - MIT License, to promote learning and free usage should it be educational for individuals in a corporate setting.
 - Please do not attempt to sell this software, as it will likely be met with legal resistance from Nintendo.
